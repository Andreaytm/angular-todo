	<!--This is just a paragraph of comments to bulk up the 404 file 
		so to be able to redirect my angular-todo app to repo root in IE11 using AngularJS and script as noted below. 
		IE11 has a compatibility issue for 404 files that are under 512 bytes in size 
		hence this very long unnecessary but necessary for IE11 long comment.-->
